## Background

The [STIX Whitepaper](http://stix.mitre.org/about/documents/STIX_Whitepaper_v1.0.pdf) explains the impetus for standardizing threat data in the security community.

Contact <stix@mitre.org> for a complimentary introduction to the standard and how it can be applied to your data. If you're local to Boston or Washington, DC - training is available in person or via group teleconference. 

## Data model
STIX data model is represented as XML data conforming with STIX schemas.

Visit [the release page](http://stix.mitre.org/language/version1.1.1/) and choose which bundle of content you want to download. The recommended download is the [All Files (Offline)](http://stix.mitre.org/language/version1.1.1/stix_v1.1.1_offline.zip) bundle. It contains all STIX schemas, all CybOX schemas, and all extension/external schemas. 

Additionally,  "Documentation" and "Data Dictionaries" describe STIX constructs and related fields.

## Writing STIX Content

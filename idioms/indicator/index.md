A STIX [Indicator](/documentation/indicator/IndicatorType) conveys specific Observable patterns combined with contextual information intended to represent artifacts and/or behaviors of interest within a cyber security context. They consist of one or more Observable patterns potentially mapped to a related [TTP](/idioms/ttp) context and adorned with other relevant metadata on things like confidence in the indicator’s assertion, handling restrictions, valid time windows, likely impact, sightings of the indicator, structured test mechanisms for detection, related campaigns, suggested courses of action, related indicators, the source of the Indicator, etc. Recognizing limitations in current standardized approaches of representation, STIX leverages community knowledge and best practices to define a new Indicator structure for representing Indicator information. 

These indicator idioms describe either types of indicators based on the data that they match against (i.e. focus on the "test" portion of the indicator) or the indicator as it relates to other STIX constructs (i.e. the "context" portion of the indicator). There are also idioms that explain different pieces of the indicator itself, like confidence and valid time position.

### IP Address used for C2

This idiom walks through the very common use case where you have an indicator where the "test" is a simple IP address and the context is that the IP is being used to host a C2 server. This is often implemented via a network block to that IP address as the external firewall.

### Malware Hash

This idiom is an example of a host-based indicator that looks for a piece of malware through a file hash. File hash watchlists generally take this form.

### Malicious URL

This idiom is an example of a malicious URL indicator that represents a URL and indicates that it's a delivery mechanism for a piece of malware.

### Phishing E-mail w/ Malicious Attachment

Describes an indicator for a phishing e-mail that contains a malicious attachment

### Test Mechanisms

Test mechanisms are a part of the indicator data model that allow you to represent common methods for detecting indicators within the indicator itself (either in conjunction or instead of the standard CybOX mechanism) in order to easily implement that indicator. These idioms describe various types of test mechanisms:

* [Snort Test Mechanism »](snort-test-mechanism)
* [OpenIOC Test Mechanism »](openioc-test-mechanism)
* [YARA Test Mechanism »](yara-test-mechanism)

### Indicator Composition

This set of idioms describes various methods for composing lists of indicators (multiple IP addresses or malicious URLs, for example). {% comment %}For a writeup on when to use each form of composition, see the [suggested practices](/documentation/indicator/IndicatorType#suggested-practices-composition) for indicator composition.{% endcomment %}

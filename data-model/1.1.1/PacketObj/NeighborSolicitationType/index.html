<h1>NeighborSolicitationType<span class="subdued">Network Packet Object Schema</span></h1>

<p>Nodes send Neighbor Solicitations to request the link-layer address of a target node while also providing their own link-layer address to the target. Neighbor Solicitations are multicast when the node needs to resolve an address and unicast when the node seeks to verify the reachability of a neighbor. (type=135; code=0).</p>

<h1>IncidentBaseType<span class="subdued">STIX Common Schema</span></h1>

<p>This type represents the STIX Incident component. It is extended using the XML Schema Extension feature by the STIX Incident type itself. Users of this type who wish to express a full incident using STIX must do so using the xsi:type extension feature. The STIX-defined Incident type is <a href='/data-model/1.1.1/incident/IncidentType'>IncidentType</a> in the http://stix.mitre.org/Incident-1 namespace. This type is defined in the incident.xsd file or at the URL http://stix.mitre.org/XMLSchema/incident/1.1.1/incident.xsd.
Alternatively, uses that require simply specifying an idref as a reference to an incident defined elsewhere can do so without specifying an xsi:type.</p>

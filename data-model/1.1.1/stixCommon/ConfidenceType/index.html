The default vocabulary type is <a href='/data-model/1.1.1/stixVocabs/HighMediumLowVocab-1.0'>HighMediumLowVocab-1.0</a> in the http://stix.mitre.org/default_vocabularies-1 namespace. This type is defined in the stix_default_vocabularies.xsd file or at the URL http://stix.mitre.org/XMLSchema/default_vocabularies/1.1.1/stix_default_vocabularies.xsd.</p>
        
          <p>Users may also define their own vocabulary using the type extension mechanism, specify a vocabulary name and reference using the attributes, or simply use this as a string field.</p>

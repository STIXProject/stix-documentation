<h1>EventPoolType<span class="subdued">CybOX Core Schema</span></h1>

<p>The <a href='/data-model/1.1.1/cybox/EventPoolType'>EventPoolType</a> enables the description of CybOX Events in a space-efficient pooled manner with the actual Observable structures defined in the CybOX schema containing references to the pooled Event elements. This reduces redundancy caused when identical Events occur multiple times within a set of defined Observables.</p>

A STIX [Incident](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/incident/IncidentType) conveys information about a cyber security incident. This may be the most familiar STIX construct to those with a background in computer security and incident response. As you'd expect, it contains a good deal of information about what occurred, the impact of the incident on systems and information, the incident timeline, points of contact, and other descriptive information.

In the STIX relationship model, incidents can be related to the threat actors involved, the campaigns that they're a part of, courses of action that were taken or were suggested, indicators that were used to detect the incident or were discovered as part of the investigation, TTPs that were used to carry out the incident, and observables that were detected during the incident.

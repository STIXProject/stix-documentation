title: CVE in an Exploit Target
---

Threat intelligence often contains references to the vulnerabilities that threat actors are targeting. When those vulnerabilities have been formally disclosed and identified (i.e. are not 0-day or unknown vulnerabilites) they are almost always identified via a [CVE](http://cve.mitre.org) identifier. This idiom describes how to use the STIX Exploit Target element to represent a disclosed vulnerability via its CVE ID.

## Scenario

In this scenario, we'll describe [CVE 2013-3893](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-3893) using the STIX exploit target element.

## Data model

<img src="diagram.png" alt="Representing a CVE in an Exploit Target" class="aside-text" />

The relevant STIX component, [Exploit Target](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/et/ExploitTargetType), is used to represent potential targets of cyber threat activity. This idiom describes using the exploit target to represent a disclosed vulnerability via its CVE identifier. The advantage of doing this is easier correlation with the large set of existing tools and data sources that already work with CVE.

As you can see, this is a very simple idiom to represent. The `Title` field simply gives the exploit target a human-readable title. Similarly, `Description` and `Short Description` could be used to give it longer human-readable descriptions if desired.

The `Vulnerability` field is used to represent the vulnerability itself. This field is implemented via [VulnerabilityType](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/et/VulnerabilityType), which can be used to identify vulnerabilities via a CVE ID (as here), OSVDB ID, or even use [CVRF](http://www.icasi.org/cvrf-1.1) to characterize an undisclosed vulnerability.

Representing the CVE ID is as easy as filling out the `CVE ID` field with a property-formatted CVE identifier.

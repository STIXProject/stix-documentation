A STIX [Exploit Target](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/et/ExploitTargetType) conveys information about a technical vulnerability, weakness, or misconfiguration in software, systems, or networks that may be targeted for exploitation by an adversary. The exploit target component leverages current standard approaches in identifying and describing vulnerabilities through the suggested option of using [CVE](http://cve.mitre.org) and/or [OSVDB](http://osvdb.org) IDs to identify named vulnerabilities, [CVRF](http://icasi.org/cvrf-1.1) to describe 0-day or other unnamed vulnerabilities, and [CVSS](http://www.first.org/cvss‎) to score vulnerabilities. Additionally, [CCE](http://cce.mitre.org) is used as the suggested method to identify configuration items and [CWE](http://cwe.mitre.org) as a mechanism for representing software weaknesses.

In the STIX relationship model, exploit targets are used to identify possible targets of a [TTP](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/ttp/TTPType) and can reference [courses of action](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/coa/CourseOfActionType) as potential mechanisms to remediate the exploit target.

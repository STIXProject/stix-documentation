<h1>VulnerabilityType<span class="subdued">Exploit Target Schema</span></h1>

<p>Characterizes an individual vulnerability.
In addition to capturing basic information and references to vulnerability registries, this type is intended to be extended to enable the structured description of a vulnerability by using the XML Schema extension feature. The STIX default extension uses the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) schema to do so. The extension that defines this is captured in the <a href='/documentation/stix-cvrf/CVRF1.1InstanceType'>CVRF1.1InstanceType</a> in the http://stix.mitre.org/extensions/Vulnerability#CVRF1.1-1 namespace. This type is defined in the extensions/vulnerability/cvrf_1.1_vulnerability.xsd file or at the URL http://stix.mitre.org/XMLSchema/extensions/vulnerability/cvrf_1.1/1.1.1/cvrf_1.1_vulnerability.xsd.</p>

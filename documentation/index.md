      <h4><a href="validation">Validation</a></h4>

      <p>Checking whether STIX content is valid is an important part of helping
      to ensure compatibility. The STIX Validation rules outline how STIX
      documents can be validated against either STIX in general or against a
      specific profile.</p>

      <h4><a href="suggested-practices">Suggested Practices</a></h4>

      <p>Suggested practices (often called best practices) are guidelines that
      will help you create STIX content that conforms to the STIX design goals
      and ensures the best compatibility with other STIX tooling.</p>

      <h4><a href="security">Security Considerations</a></h4>

      <p>Security considerations are a list of security issues that might arise
      when processing STIX content. The guide is non-exhaustive and does not
      take the place of security coding practices or other security processes
      but can be a good starting point.</p>

      <h4><a href="utilities">Utilities</a></h4>

      <p>The utilities page has information on both STIX-provided and
      community-provided utilities for working with STIX. It includes both
      user-level utilities such as visualization tools and developer-focused
      tooling such as bindings and APIs.</p>

      <h4><a href="profiles">Profiles</a></h4>

      <p>STIX Profiles are a mechanism to allow communities of interest to
      define how they intend to use STIX. They're most often used to define
      which parts of the STIX/CybOX data models are in scope.</p>

      <h4><a href="idioms">Idioms</a></h4>

      <p>STIX idioms describe how common patterns in threat intelligence (for
      example, C2 IPs for a trojan) are represented in STIX. They're similar to
      programming language idioms in that they document common patterns for
      representing content in STIX.</p>

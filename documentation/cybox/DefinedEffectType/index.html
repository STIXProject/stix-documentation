<h1>DefinedEffectType<span class="subdued">CybOX Core Schema</span></h1>

<p>The <a href='/documentation/cybox/DefinedEffectType'>DefinedEffectType</a> is an abstract placeholder for various predefined Object Effect types (e.g. DataReadEffect, ValuesEnumeratedEffect or StateChangeEffect) that can be instantiated in its place through extension of the DefinedEffectType. This mechanism enables the specification of a broad range of types of potential complex action effects on Objects. The set of Defined_Effect types (extending the DefinedEffectType) are maintained as part of the core CybOX schema.</p>

          <p>This field is implemented through the xsi:type controlled vocabulary extension mechanism. No default vocabulary type has been defined for STIX 1.1.1. Users may either define their own vocabulary using the type extension mechanism, specify a vocabulary name and reference using the attributes, or simply use this as a free string field.</p>

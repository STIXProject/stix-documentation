<h1>OVAL5.10TestMechanismType<span class="subdued">OVAL Test Mechanism Instance Schema</span></h1>

<p>The OVALTestMechanismType provides an extension to the <a href='/documentation/indicator/TestMechanismType'>TestMechanismType</a> which imports and leverages the OVAL schema in order to include OVAL Definitions as the test mechanism.</p>

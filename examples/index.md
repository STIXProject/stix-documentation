## APT1

STIX is able to [encode threat intelligence related to APT1 (.zip)](https://stix.mitre.org/language/version1.1.1/samples/apt1-stix-1.1.1.zip
) for the rich set of Threat Actors, TTPs and Indicators listed in the [original report](http://intelreport.mandiant.com)

Note that the conversion is not exhaustive. Technical indicators listed in the original appendices were generated using the [Python scripting interface](http://github.com/stixproject/python-stix)

Another [utility was used](https://github.com/STIXProject/stix-to-html) to convert the resulting XML files to HTML.

## Poison Ivy

A [STIX version of intelligence related to use of Poison Ivy (.zip)](https://stix.mitre.org/language/version1.1.1/samples/poison_ivy-stix-1.1.1.zip) was created based on the [original report](http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/targeted-attack/2013/08/pivy-assessing-damage-and-extracting-intel.html)

This conversion process was similar to the APT1 example.

The following rules were used to convert the report:

- Usage of Poison Ivy malware is a `TTP`
- Each customized version of Poison Ivy is linked as a `Variant` to the relevant `Threat Actor`
- Spear Phishing and Waterholing are also `TTP`
- Targeted victims are their own `TTP`
- Mitigation using Calamine is a `Course of Action` 
- Malicious actors are both `Campaign` and `Threat Actor`

**Affects Backwards Compatibility**: ***YES***

#### Background Information
In the STIX 1.0.1 data model, there is a relationship from TTP to Exploit Target. That structure, however, does not use the standard STIX relationship mechanism but uses a straight list of exploit targets. This is inconsistent with other relationships (a downside in and of itself) and also means that relationships from TTPs to Exploit Targets are not capable of expressing the relationship name or type, confidence, and other information present on standard STIX relationships.

An example of the current relationship structure is:
```
<ttp:TTP id="example-1" xsi:type="ttp:TTPType">
  <!-- snip -->
  <TTP:Exploit_Targets>
    <stixCommon:Exploit_Target idref="example-2"/>
  </TTP:Exploit_Targets>
</ttp:TTP>
```

Note that the type of ```TTP:Exploit_Targets``` is ```stixCommon:ExploitTargetsType``` instead of an appropriate relationship type.

#### Proposal
This proposal suggests changing the relationship from TTP to Exploit Targets from the custom mechanism to a standard STIX relationship. This ***will*** be a backwards-incompatible change but is being considered for 1.1 because it is flagged as a bug.

An example of this in use is:

```
<ttp:TTP id="example-1" xsi:type="ttp:TTPType">
  <!-- snip -->
  <TTP:Exploit_Targets>
    <TTP:Related_Exploit_Target>
      <stixCommon:Relationship>Targets Vulnerability</stixCommon:Relationship>
      <stixCommon:Confidence>
        <stixCommon:Value xsi:type="stixVocabs:HighMediumLowVocab-1.0">High</stixCommon:Value>
      </stixCommon:Confidence>
      <stixCommon:Exploit_Target idref="example-2"/>
    </TTP:Related_Exploit_Target>
  </TTP:Exploit_Targets>
</ttp:TTP>
```

Note that it is not backwards-compatible at a schema level with the 1.0.1 construct, but also note how it allows for the capture of the relationship and confidence fields.

This change will be implemented by extending the ```GenericRelationshipListType``` and ```GenericRelationshipType``` constructs to match how all other relationships in STIX are defined.

#### Impact
This change will break backwards incompatibility for any producers and consumers using the TTP to Exploit_Target relationship.

On the other hand, the advantage of making this change is that relationships will be 100% consistent across STIX plus it will give users the ability to specify relationship type, confidence, and other data points on relationships that in 1.0.1 they cannot.

Please carefully evaluate whether this change is worth making in 1.1 or whether it should be delayed until a major update (2.0).

#### Requested Feedback

1. Should this change be made in STIX 1.1?
